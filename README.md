 I'm proud to present Chacha Pakistani by Team Digi Dreamers which is a little project we created for the Pakistan Game Developer's Conference 2023. The game introduces a Character named Chacha Makhan who sets off on a journey across Pakistan and shows the different people, aspects and diverse culture of Paistan as he travels to various cities across Pakistan.

‚ö†Ô∏è**RELEASE NOTES** ‚ö†Ô∏è
We only had 4 days to learn Unity and implement our idea so we weren't able to implement our idea completely and decided to create this as a meme game so I hope you'll enjoy it. Last but not least I want to thank all of my friends, my Mentors and especially our teachers for supporting us through this journey. For those of you who know keep following me for more amazing content and I hope you'll find this little meme game fun to enjoy. We also added the official design concept of Chacha Makhan at the start as we couldn't implement it completely.Stay Lit. ü§ü


**HOW TO PLAY**
1) Use the Left and Right arrow keys or "A" and "D" keys to move 
2) Press the space bar to jump
3) In case you fall down start from the start by restarting the game (there is no death logic so you just keep falling down endlessly)
4) Press alt + F4 to exit the game as there's no exit button or UI for this game
